Enhancement Plan for Deep Research AI Agentic System
1. Integrating Tavily and Perplexity for Complementary Web Retrieval
Use Both APIs Strategically: Leverage Tavily Search API for precise, factual web content retrieval, and Perplexity API for broad contextual summaries. Tavily is optimized for accuracy and real-time data access, letting the agent pull raw content or focused snippets with high precision​
blog.tavily.com
. In contrast, Perplexity provides well-cited, synthesized answers that include summary and context from multiple sources​
felloai.com
. Using both in tandem ensures the agent gets deep details (via Tavily) and high-level overviews (via Perplexity) for any given query. Actionable Steps:
Integrate Tavily for High-Precision Search: Add a tool (or extend the existing tavily_search) to query Tavily with appropriate parameters (e.g. search_depth="advanced", chunks_per_source tuning). Configure it to retrieve a handful of highly relevant results, possibly including raw page content when needed​
docs.tavily.com
​
docs.tavily.com
. Rationale: Tavily’s search can be fine-tuned to return targeted information (even full text) from the most relevant sources, giving the agent a reliable knowledge base for facts and quotes.
Integrate Perplexity for Summarization: Introduce a perplexity_search tool that sends the user query (or sub-queries) to the Perplexity API. Parse its response to obtain a concise answer and list of source citations. Rationale: Perplexity acts as a “research assistant,” quickly summarizing what’s on the web and citing sources. This provides the agent a broad contextual summary of the topic, highlighting key points and references without manual aggregation​
felloai.com
.
Design Hybrid Retrieval Workflow: Implement a tool-routing logic in the agent’s planning or search stage to use both tools without duplication. For example:
On a new query, first call Perplexity to get an overview answer and the sources it cites. Record those source URLs.
Next, feed specific follow-up searches into Tavily (or directly use Tavily’s extract) for each top source or for aspects that Perplexity’s answer mentions. This yields full content and additional details from those URLs.
If Perplexity’s summary already addresses a sub-question well, the agent can skip redundant Tavily calls for that aspect.
Conversely, if Tavily finds a highly relevant page not cited by Perplexity, that content can be summarized or injected into the analysis separately.
Merge and Filter Results: Develop a merging routine to combine findings from both tools. For instance, aggregate unique source content from Tavily with the insight from Perplexity’s summary. Filter out duplicate information by comparing source URLs or key sentences. Rationale: This prevents redundant content – if both tools surface the same fact or source, it should appear only once in the agent’s knowledge pool. The agent’s analysis node can then work with a richer but non-redundant set of information.
Iterative Use for Complementarity: Consider using Perplexity at both the beginning and end of the research cycle. Initially, Perplexity guides what to search (broad areas to cover). After using Tavily to collect raw data, you might ask Perplexity follow-up questions to fill any gaps or get updated context (“Is there recent news on X?”). Option: Route these follow-up questions to Perplexity only if the analysis stage flags an information gap related to timeliness or breadth.
Rationale & Benefits: By combining Tavily’s precision with Perplexity’s breadth, the agent can avoid blind spots. Tavily ensures factual accuracy and up-to-date raw content (crucial for trustworthiness​
blog.tavily.com
), while Perplexity ensures the agent sees the bigger picture and doesn’t miss relevant context or perspectives. The tool-routing logic ensures efficiency – each tool is used where it adds the most value, minimizing API calls. This hybrid approach will ground the agent’s answers in reliable sources (via Tavily) and provide well-rounded explanations (via Perplexity), all while preventing duplication of effort.
2. Adopting Claude Sonnet 3.7 as the Core LLM
Leverage Claude 3.7 for Reasoning: Replace or augment the current GPT-4 model with Claude Sonnet 3.7 for the agent’s reasoning and generation tasks. Claude 3.7 is known for significantly enhanced reasoning and processing capabilities, excelling at complex tasks and multi-document analysis​
blog.box.com
. It also offers extremely large context windows (up to 100k tokens) for input, meaning it can ingest and reason over far more content at once than GPT-4​
anthropic.com
. This makes Claude especially suited to a research assistant that needs to analyze many sources or long articles in one go. Key Decisions:
Full Replacement vs. Hybrid: We recommend using Claude 3.7 as the primary LLM for all stages of the workflow (planning, analysis, drafting, etc.), given its strengths. This would mean instantiating the agent’s MODEL as Claude (via the appropriate API or LangChain wrapper) instead of GPT-4. Claude’s improved reasoning should benefit every step, from interpreting the query to synthesizing final answers. However, you could adopt a hybrid approach during transition:
Option A: Claude for Analysis & Drafting, GPT-4 for Verification. Use Claude 3.7 for generating the research plan, analyzing content, and drafting the answer (stages where nuanced understanding and long context help). Then optionally use GPT-4 in the fact-checking or finalizing stage as a “second pair of eyes” to verify and polish the output. Rationale: GPT-4 is a strong model too; keeping it for final checks might catch any subtle errors. But this adds complexity and cost, so only implement if you find specific shortcomings in Claude’s output that GPT-4 can mitigate.
Option B: Claude for All Stages. Simplify the pipeline by using Claude 3.7 for every LLM invocation. In LangGraph, this is straightforward (just change the model used by each agent node to Claude’s). This ensures consistency in style and reasoning throughout the process. You would fully benefit from Claude’s speed and longer context without juggling models.
Claude’s Special Advantages: Make sure to exploit areas where Claude shines:
Long-Context Summarization: Claude can absorb hundreds of pages of text and summarize or analyze them in a single pass​
anthropic.com
​
anthropic.com
. This is ideal for the analysis agent node – instead of splitting content into many small chunks for GPT-4, you can feed Claude a large concatenated chunk (or the entire set of Tavily results) if needed. It can produce a coherent analysis across all that information, reducing the need for iterative chunk processing.
Nuanced Synthesis and Instructions: Claude 3.7 has been noted for its ability to follow complex instructions and produce structured, nuanced outputs. It should handle the “research plan” creation and “finalizing” (editing) steps gracefully, potentially yielding more organized and articulate answers than before. Early reports suggest Claude 3.7 is extremely fast and good at complex reasoning​
blog.box.com
, so stages like planning or brainstorming sub-questions may become more efficient.
Conversational Tone and Safety: If the user interface involves back-and-forth with the AI, Claude is known for its friendly conversational style and adherence to instructions (Anthropic models have strong helpfulness/honesty training). This could improve the drafting agent output quality in terms of clarity and alignment with user intent.
Implementation Steps:
Update the LangChain LLM instantiation to use Claude 3.7 (e.g., via Anthropic’s API or a LangChain ChatAnthropic class if available). Ensure you have access to Claude 3.7 (the “Sonnet” version) via API.
Adjust prompts if necessary: Claude might have slight differences in how it handles system prompts or formatting. Test the existing prompts for each agent with Claude and refine wording as needed (Claude might not require as much coaxing for format).
Monitor performance: Compare a few example queries using GPT-4 vs Claude 3.7. Ensure that Claude’s outputs are on par or improved in depth. Pay attention to any differences in style or any new limitations (for instance, if Claude is too verbose or if it has any maximum length constraints in responses).
Decide on fallback: If GPT-4 was previously used for its knowledge cut-off or reliability on certain facts, you may keep an emergency fallback tool (for example, if Claude fails to answer or returns an error, call GPT-4). In practice, this might rarely be needed, but it’s an option to maintain robustness.
Rationale: Moving to Claude Sonnet 3.7 should boost the system’s overall reasoning depth and allow handling more information per turn. By replacing GPT-4 in core reasoning, the agent may generate more insightful and detailed answers without missing connections between disparate pieces of info (thanks to the larger context window). The decision to use Claude in all stages vs. a hybrid is a trade-off between simplicity and any specific strengths of GPT-4 you want to retain. Given Claude 3.7’s strong performance (even comparable or superior to other top models in many domains​
blog.box.com
), using it across the board is likely the simplest and most effective route. It will also streamline the system (one LLM to maintain/tune) and possibly reduce costs if Claude’s API pricing is more favorable than GPT-4’s for long contexts.
3. Evolving the LangGraph Agent-Node Architecture with Dynamic Orchestration
The current architecture (a linear StateGraph of agent nodes with a loop for additional research) is well-structured and should be maintained for clarity. Each node (planner, search, extraction, analysis, drafting, fact-checking, finalizing) has a defined responsibility, which is a strength. The enhancement here is to make this setup more dynamic and reactive, approaching a multi-agent orchestration without losing the stability of the defined workflow. Maintain Modular Agents: Keep each function (node) as a distinct “agent” with its own prompt and task (this is already the case). This modularity aligns with LangGraph’s design where each node can be seen as an independent agent in a broader graph​
blog.langchain.dev
​
blog.langchain.dev
. Ensuring each agent’s prompt is optimized (and possibly specialized to Claude, per above) will yield better per-component performance. For instance, you might enrich the analysis agent prompt to explicitly request quantitative evidence or multiple perspectives (making it behave more “expert”). Introduce a Supervising Controller: To get more reactive behavior, consider adding a top-level controller agent (or utilizing LangGraph’s routing capabilities) that monitors the overall process and can inject decisions. In practice, since LangGraph already uses a graph with conditional edges, your “controller” could simply be additional logic at certain junctions:
After the analysis node, you already check needs_more_research. This is a form of controller logic. You can expand this: e.g., after drafting, you could have another check agent like needs_clarification that decides if the answer should be enriched further or simplified, and route accordingly (perhaps loop back to analysis with a new focus if something is missing).
You could create a meta-agent that observes the state (perhaps the metadata field or the content of draft) and decides which node to invoke next beyond the static graph order. LangGraph allows dynamic invocation of nodes via conditions or even via a custom routing node. For example, a “router” node could examine the query type: if the query explicitly asks for data or metrics, the router might invoke a specialized sub-agent to gather structured data (see next point) before proceeding.
Dynamic Tool Routing: LangChain and LangGraph support the idea of an agent deciding among tools. You could incorporate a Router Agent that chooses between multiple search tools or strategies at runtime. Instead of always using both Tavily and Perplexity every time, a router logic (possibly implemented as part of the search agent or as its own node) could decide:
For factual queries needing high precision, use Tavily (and maybe multiple sub-queries).
For open-ended exploratory queries, call Perplexity first to narrow down the scope.
For numeric data queries, call a hypothetical “data retrieval” tool or a different API.
This essentially means making the “Search” step multi-modal. You can implement this by giving the search agent access to both tools and some criteria (in its prompt or code) to pick which to use. LangChain’s toolkit approach allows an agent to choose a tool based on the query; in LangGraph, you might encode this as a conditional path (different node for each tool). For example, have a search_general node (uses Perplexity) and search_precise node (uses Tavily), and route to one or both depending on the query or after an initial attempt. Optional Multi-Agent Collaboration: As a more advanced evolution, consider splitting responsibilities between multiple collaborative agents rather than a single chain. For instance:
A Researcher Agent that specializes in formulating sub-queries and gathering evidence (could use Tavily and Perplexity tools as needed).
An Analyst Agent that waits for the Researcher’s findings and then synthesizes them into a coherent answer.
A Verifier Agent that checks the Analyst’s output against sources and metrics. These agents could communicate via a shared state or message buffer (LangGraph supports passing state between nodes as you have). In effect, this is similar to your current pipeline but conceptually separates roles. The advantage is you can give each agent its own LLM persona/prompt (e.g., researcher is curious and exhaustive, analyst is articulate and concise, verifier is skeptical and detail-oriented). They can run in sequence as now, or even in cycles (the verifier could ask the researcher for clarification if something is not backed by evidence, etc., though that adds complexity).
Supervising Controller for Multi-Agent: In a true multi-agent setup, a top-level controller (or simply the LangGraph edges) would coordinate these agents. For example, the controller might decide to spin up an additional search if the verifier isn’t satisfied. This moves toward an autonomous loop style (akin to AutoGPT or others) but constrained within your graph framework for reliability. 

Illustration: The diagram above (from an AWS blog example using LangGraph) shows a LangGraph multi-agent workflow with a central controller logic. Each purple node is an agent with a specific role (Events DB, Weather, Restaurants, Analysis), and the diamond indicates a conditional route based on results. A similar orchestrator approach in our system could allow dynamic decisions – e.g., if initial search fails to find recent info, route to a different strategy. This kind of setup demonstrates how specialized agents (or nodes) can be coordinated with conditions to achieve a goal, under a supervising flow. Our system can adopt a scaled-down version of this: maintain our sequence for normal operation, but have conditional branches or parallel agent calls when needed (such as simultaneous multi-tool searches, etc.). Practical Steps to Implement:
Use LangGraph’s graph.add_conditional_edges (as you did for needs_more_research) to add more decision points. For instance, you might add a condition after the fact_checking node: if important facts are unverified, loop back to the search or analysis node with a new goal to verify them.
Leverage LangChain’s router chains or simply a custom logic inside an agent node to choose tools. Since you have the code for each node, inside search_agent you could write Python logic to check the query or state and decide which API to call first (this is a simple way to implement dynamic tool routing within the LangGraph node).
If exploring multiple agents concurrently, LangGraph can run nodes asynchronously or in parallel if they don’t have direct dependencies. For example, you could in principle launch two search sub-nodes in parallel (one using each API) and then join their results. This would complicate the state handling but could speed up retrieval. As a first iteration, stick to sequential but with logic, and later consider parallel execution if performance demands it.
Ensure the “controller” decisions are transparent via the state’s metadata (for debugging). For instance, log which tool was chosen or how many loops were done. This helps in tuning the conditions.
Rationale: By evolving the static graph into a more reactive system, the agent becomes adaptive to different queries and situations. It won’t always follow a one-size path; it can intelligently choose how to gather info or which agent to emphasize. We still keep the benefits of the current architecture – clarity of each stage and ease of debugging – but gain flexibility. This approach is aligned with advanced agent systems where specialization and orchestration improve outcomes​

. In short, we maintain our solid backbone (LangGraph nodes for each task) but allow optional detours and collaborations to handle edge cases or particularly complex queries.
4. Addressing Current Limitations in Answers
The user has noted that final answers sometimes lack depth, timeliness, or quantitative backing. We will tackle these issues directly in the enhanced pipeline:
Improving Depth and Comprehensiveness: The integration of Perplexity and Tavily (Section 1) will already supply a richer pool of information. Beyond that, we can add a dedicated step or prompt emphasis to increase depth:
Augment the analysis agent to not only summarize findings but also identify any additional angles or subtopics that should be covered for a thorough answer. For example, after synthesizing, the analysis agent can populate state.analyzed_content["missing_aspects"] by comparing the query vs. found info. This could use a prompt like “Have we covered all relevant dimensions of this query? If not, list what’s missing.” If any are listed, the loop can treat them as new search queries.
Introduce a brief “reflection” step (could be part of finalizing agent or a new agent before final answer) where the LLM reviews the draft answer and ensures it’s comprehensive. Many modern agent frameworks use a self-reflection to catch shallow answers​
medium.com
. Here, Claude (or GPT-4) could be prompted: “Double-check the answer for completeness. Is any important detail or explanation missing given the question?” If yes, either expand the answer or flag the gap for another search iteration.
Ensure that the agent cites multiple sources for multi-faceted questions. Depth often comes from corroborating points with evidence. If currently the answer tends to rely on one source per point, encourage using several (the drafting prompt can be instructed: “Include diverse points of view or data points from multiple sources in the answer”).
Ensuring Timeliness (Up-to-date information): Utilize the tools and query planning to incorporate the latest information:
Whenever the query or context suggests a time component (e.g., “current status”, “recent”, “2025”, etc.), programmatically set Tavily’s time_range parameter (like last year or last month)​
docs.tavily.com
. This filters results to more recent data, avoiding outdated info.
If Perplexity is used, leverage its strength in retrieving current content (it does real-time search by default). Additionally, consider adding a “news check” tool: for certain queries, call an API or search engine for news (even a simple Bing News search via Tavily if supported, or an RSS feed) to see if something new has emerged on the topic.
Maintain a field in state (e.g., metadata["last_update_check"]) to record when the info was last fetched, and possibly the newest date found in sources. The drafting agent can be instructed to mention if information is as of a certain date, which at least cues the user about timeliness. For instance: “(Information updated as of March 2025.)”.
If feasible, schedule periodic updates for static knowledge: For example, if the system is used repeatedly on similar topics, cache results but refresh them after some time. This goes beyond immediate query handling, but ensures the knowledge base the agent draws on isn’t stale. (This is more of a backend improvement – e.g., pre-fetch new performance metrics monthly.)
Adding Quantitative Backing and Metrics: This is crucial for questions like the LLM competitors query that explicitly ask for metrics. Several enhancements can help:
Targeted Search for Numbers: Modify the search agent to detect when a sub-question likely requires statistics or metrics. For example, if the query includes phrases like “how many”, “what percentage”, “metrics”, or in the LLM case “parameters, accuracy, benchmark”, then formulate specific searches for those. The planner agent could add sub-queries like “<Model X> accuracy on benchmark Y” or “<Model X> number of parameters / training data size”, etc. Tavily and Perplexity can then retrieve those facts. Essentially, guide the agent to ask for numbers directly.
Incorporate Structured Data Sources: In addition to free-text web, use specialized sources for metrics. For LLM performance, sites like PapersWithCode or HuggingFace Leaderboards provide structured benchmark results. We could integrate a simple scraper or API for such sources. For example, a tool that queries PapersWithCode for “state of the art on X benchmark” or pulls a known JSON of model metrics. This could populate a structured list of metrics in the state (like a dictionary of {Model: metric value}). Even if not fully automated, having the agent search those sites via Tavily (with site:paperswithcode.com <model name> queries) could yield tables of numbers to parse.
Quantitative Reasoning Tools: If the agent needs to do math on retrieved numbers (though most often it just needs to report them), you could incorporate a calculator or small Python eval tool. LangChain provides a calculator tool that the LLM could call. For instance, if the question asks for growth or differences, the LLM can fetch raw numbers then call a calculator tool to compute the result. This ensures accuracy in arithmetic and gives more confidence in numeric answers.
Prompt the Draft to Include Numbers: Adjust the drafting agent’s prompt to explicitly instruct: “Where applicable, include quantitative metrics or figures to support the answer, citing the source.” This nudges the model to not just say “Model X is better” but “Model X scored 90% on test Y, whereas Model Z scored 85%​
felloai.com
” (for example). During fact-checking, verify those numbers against the sources in content_details so the final answer remains grounded in retrieved data.
As an example improvement: if the query is about LLM competitors and metrics, the enhanced system would identify sub-questions like “GPT-4 vs Claude accuracy” and retrieve benchmark results. The final answer might say: “GPT-4, for instance, achieves about 86.4% on the MMLU knowledge benchmark, slightly above Claude 2’s 85.2% (as of late 2024), while newer models like Grok 3 are catching up​
analyticsvidhya.com
.” – This kind of detail is what we aim for.
Verification and Citations: The limitation about lacking depth can also be addressed by making sure every major claim is verified by the fact-checking agent. We should strengthen the fact-checking stage to not just compare the draft to “key findings” text, but to actively cross-verify numeric values and assertions:
If the draft answer mentions a number or “the latest data,” ensure the fact-checking agent explicitly checks if that number appears in the content details and flags if not. We might enhance verified_info in state to store each fact checked. The fact-checker could output a list like verified_info["unchecked_claims"] if something was stated without evidence. The finalizing agent can then decide to remove or replace those.
Optional: Incorporate a secondary LLM opinion: use GPT-4 as a fact-checking oracle briefly if needed (this ties back to the hybrid model idea). However, since our pipeline already has retrieved sources, relying on them is preferred over asking another LLM blindly.
Outcome: Addressing these aspects will result in answers that are richer in content and evidence. The agent will provide timely info (by actively searching recent data), include quantitative metrics and factual figures where relevant, and have multi-layer checks to ensure nothing important is omitted. The user’s original query about LLM competitors, for instance, would be answered with a crisp comparative summary and concrete metrics (parameters, benchmark scores, etc.), all properly cited. This directly remedies the prior shortfall where the answer might have been generic or missing numbers.
5. Additional Improvements and Considerations
Beyond the major enhancements above, we recommend a few more tweaks to refine the system’s architecture, tooling, and potential user experience: a. Refine the Research Flow Architecture:
Optimize Sub-Query Generation: The planner agent currently devises search queries. We can improve its prompt or logic by giving it more context on using the two search tools. For example, instruct it: “First, generate one broad query for an overview (for Perplexity), then several focused queries on specific facets (for Tavily).” This way it outputs a mix of queries tailored to our two-tool strategy. The search agent can then route accordingly. This structured approach ensures the research plan covers general context and deep dives systematically.
Iterative Loop Enhancements: The current loop (needs_more_research check) can be enriched to recognize why more research is needed. Rather than a generic True/False, it could return a label like "find_metrics" or "update_info" to indicate the type of gap. The graph can then route to a specialized path for that gap (e.g., if metrics missing, run a different search routine focused on stats). This makes the loop smarter by addressing the specific deficiency in the first pass answer.
Parallelizing Non-Dependent Tasks: As touched on, consider running some steps in parallel if it benefits performance and doesn’t complicate state handling too much. For instance, extraction of content from multiple URLs can be done concurrently (since each URL fetch is independent). LangGraph might allow asynchronous execution in the graph, or you can multi-thread the content_extraction_agent internally to fetch all URLs faster. This doesn’t change answer quality but improves latency for the end user, especially if many sources are involved.
Memory and State Management: The system currently passes a state object through nodes. If the state grows large (with lots of content), ensure that irrelevant parts are cleared or summarized before moving to the next agent (to avoid hitting token limits, though with Claude this is less an issue). For example, after analysis, you might not need the full raw content_details in the prompt for drafting – you could use just the synthesized analyzed_content. Managing the state size keeps each prompt focused and efficient.
b. Tooling Updates:
Citation Tracking: Implement a clear mechanism for tracking which source supports which part of the answer. One approach is to annotate the content_details or analyzed_content with source identifiers. For instance, when analysis agent extracts a “key finding,” also store an ID or reference to the source URL or snippet. Then, in the drafting stage, when inserting that finding into the answer, append a citation reference (like [1] or a brief cite). You can maintain a mapping of [1] -> Source Title, URL. This could be output alongside the final answer. While the exact format may depend on the interface, the idea is to let the user verify information easily.
LangChain doesn’t automate citation insertion, but you can prompt the LLM to do it: e.g., “When using a fact from a source, indicate it with a number in brackets.” The fact-checking agent can help ensure each number corresponds to a known source.
The result is similar to how Perplexity provides inline citations​
felloai.com
, but now for our custom aggregated answer. This addresses trustworthiness and allows deeper user exploration if desired.
Logging and Traceability: Utilize LangSmith or comprehensive logging to capture each step’s input/output. This is already partly done via metadata in state. Extending it: record timestamps (already doing), which tool queries were made, how long each took, how many tokens each LLM call consumed, etc. This data is invaluable for debugging and performance tuning. For example, if an answer lacked depth, the logs might show that the analysis agent didn’t get enough content – leading us to tweak the search. Structured logs also allow evaluating the system quantitatively (e.g., average number of sources per query, average loop count, etc.).
If using LangSmith (LangChain’s observability platform)​
langchain-ai.github.io
, you can easily see the execution traces of the LangGraph and identify bottlenecks or failure points. We recommend integrating this in development to iterate on prompt quality and tool usage.
Better Content Extraction: The current extract_content_from_url uses BeautifulSoup to pull text. While this works, consider switching to Tavily’s Extract API for more robust extraction. Tavily Extract is likely to handle edge cases (lazy-loaded content, text hidden behind interactions, etc.) better than a basic GET. It might also automatically respect robots.txt and not get you blocked. You could implement a new tool tavily_extract(url) which calls Tavily’s extract endpoint. According to Tavily docs, the recommended approach is indeed two-step: search then extract​
docs.tavily.com
, which matches what you do. Using Tavily’s extraction could simplify your code and possibly provide structured results (some extract APIs return JSON with sections). If sticking to your own extractor, you might at least:
Increase the len(text) limit from 8000 chars or make it configurable based on context window (with Claude 3.7, you can afford more than 8000 chars if needed).
Filter out boilerplate (nav menus, etc.) in a smarter way – maybe use readability algorithms or a library to get main content.
Extract metadata like publication date or author from pages when available, storing that in content details. This helps assess recency and credibility of sources.
Additional Tools: Consider if any other tools could enhance answers. For example, a diagram generator or table formatter: if the agent finds a lot of data, it could present it in a table. While not necessary, LangChain’s code execution tool (as in your chart example from the medium article) could even be employed to draw simple charts or format outputs. This is more of a “nice to have” for certain query types (like comparing metrics across models could be shown in a table). The architecture already supports adding such a node if you ever want to expand in that direction.
c. User Experience (UX) Ideas:
If this system is presented via an interface (web app, chat UI, etc.), some UX considerations can make it more powerful and user-friendly:
Interactive Citations: As mentioned, show citations with the answer. These could be clickable footnotes that show the source URL or even a tooltip with the source snippet. Users appreciate knowing the provenance of information, especially in a research assistant context.
Display of Intermediate Findings: Given that your pipeline produces intermediate artifacts like key_findings and identifies information_gaps, an interface could optionally display these. For instance, after the answer, a section titled “Key Findings” could list the bullet points that the analysis agent extracted, each with a source. This offers transparency (the user sees the raw evidence the answer was built on). It also helps users trust the answer’s depth—showing that, say, 5 sources were consulted and what each contributed.
Adjustable Depth or Focus: Provide the user some control if possible. For example, a toggle for “Detailed Answer vs. Brief Answer” – this could map to adjusting the number of sources or the breadth of sub-questions the planner agent generates. Another idea is a “Focus on:” feature where the user can specify what aspect interests them (e.g., “focus on recent developments” or “focus on numerical comparison”), and the agent will bias its plan towards that (perhaps by adding a keyword to queries or weighting certain content).
Progress Feedback: Long multi-step processes can leave a user waiting. If using a UI, show the steps being executed (similar to how AutoGPT prints its thoughts). For example, display “Searching for sources… (3 found)”, “Analyzing content…”, “Drafting answer…”. This manages expectations and also showcases the agent’s diligence. Since LangGraph’s state is accessible, you can stream such updates (e.g., after search node, you know how many results; after analysis, you know key points count).
Error Handling and User Prompts: If a tool fails (say a URL is not accessible, or an API times out), catch that and inform the user or auto-retry. The system should handle such errors gracefully so that the final answer is still delivered (maybe with a note if something couldn’t be fetched). Logging can catch these, but UX should surface issues only if they meaningfully affect the answer. Possibly, have the agent mention “(One source could not be retrieved, but proceeding with available data…)” if a critical source failed.
Theming and Formatting: As this is a research assistant, formatting the final answer in a readable way is key. Use Markdown in the answer for clarity: bullet lists for separate points, bold for important names or metrics, maybe tables for comparisons. The finalizing agent can be instructed to apply such formatting. A well-formatted answer is easier to scan and shows depth at a glance (e.g., seeing a list of models each with their metrics in separate bullets or a table).
Saving and History: Optionally, allow the user to save the answer or view past queries’ results. This might be outside the scope of the agent itself, but if this is an application, keeping a history of answers (with their sources) can be useful for the user to refer back without re-running the process.
By incorporating these improvements, we not only enhance the system’s intelligence and accuracy but also its usability and transparency. The goal is a robust Deep Research AI Agent that not only finds the right information and answers thoroughly, but also clearly communicates how it arrived at those answers, instilling trust in the user. Each enhancement above contributes to making the agent more reliable, user-aligned, and future-proof for complex research queries.
